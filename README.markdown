</p>

### Get up and running!

```bash
# Check that Mandy is installed.
mandy -v

# Start a new Mandy-powered site in "mysite".
mandy -i mysite -w angeldollface/mandy-template-site

# Compile your Mandy site.
mandy -c mysite

# Clean your Mandy project.
mandy -r mysite

# Test your site on "localhost".
mandy -s mysite
```

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

I'm still testing ***Mandy*** and completing the other items on the to-do list, so I haven't figured out the conventional ways of packaging yet. To install ***Mandy*** for now, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.org) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed. Once you have both installed, run this command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy
```
